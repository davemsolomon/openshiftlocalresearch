the goal is to experiment with icsp

rather than host a local image repo

i created a free personal registry on dockerhub called davemsolomon/davemregistry
docker push davemsolomon/davemregistry:tagname




## icsp.yml
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
    - mirrors:
      - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davemsolomon/davemregistry
      source: registry.redhat.io/ocs4
